# Dashcam

React-native dashcam app with livestream escalation.

The application is meant to be run from a dash-mounted phone.

Normally, it is recording to a SD card. There is also the ability to livestream.

Livestreams are chosen based on need.

The use case I've considered most is a police stop. The scenario I imagine is you say "Ok Google, Tell Dcam that we're being pulled over." Your stream is shared with an operator who identifies your need for at the least one team and begins finding one.
